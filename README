This is a small REST api meant to showcase some uses of Spring Boot and Google Cloud Engine BigQuery

a credentials env var would need to be set when you run this to actually query GCE

usage:

curl -XPOST 'localhost:8080/blsdata -d {"year":"1999"}'

returns JSON results from the GCE table: bigquery-public-data.bls.unemployment_cps, filtered by year

these results are also written out to a local .json file in the working directory inside 'blsDataStore'

said results can then be requested again via:

curl -XGET 'locahost:8080/blsdata/1999'
